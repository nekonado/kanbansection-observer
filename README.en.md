### üê£ Easter Egg: The Secret Behind "Kanbansection Observer" üê£

If you've opened this section, perhaps you're in search of something special? Congratulations, you've discovered a little secret! Did the name "Kanbansection Observer" ring any bells? Yes, it's a playful combination with the "Intersection Observer API".

The joke here adds a bit of irony to the fact that this extension doesn't actually use the Intersection Observer API (it's implemented using the Mutation Observer API instead).

But that's not all. For those who've found this easter egg, here's another secret: developing this extension wasn't just about improving work efficiency. We aim to bring more light not only to your kanban boards but to your daily tasks as well.

So, if this little joke added some fun to your day, we're glad. And if this extension enhances your experience with kanban boards, please share it with friends! The developer, [@nekonado](https://github.com/nekonado), looks forward to your feedback!
